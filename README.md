## Featured Project — Applied Data Analysis

### The Duality of Similarity — Reddit Negativity & Similarity
🔗 **Live website:** https://loris-verga.github.io/TheDualityOfSimilarity/

Applied data analysis project exploring how similarity between Reddit communities relates to negative sentiment and discourse dynamics.  
The project combines data preprocessing, similarity metrics, sentiment analysis, and web-based data storytelling to analyze large-scale online interactions.

**Skills:**  
Data Analysis · NLP · Sentiment Analysis · Similarity Metrics · Data Visualization

## Machine Learning Project

### Road Segmentation from Aerial Imagery (U-Net Ensembles)
📄 **Project report (PDF):**  
[Open report](./road-segmentation-unet-report.pdf)

Machine learning project comparing classical and deep learning approaches for semantic road segmentation in aerial imagery.  
The study evaluates a Random Forest baseline, a custom CNN, and a deep learning ensemble combining U-Net++ (ResNet34 encoder) and U-Net (EfficientNet-B3 encoder), using rigorous validation and segmentation-specific metrics.

**Skills:**  
Machine Learning · Deep Learning · CNNs · U-Net · Semantic Segmentation · PyTorch
